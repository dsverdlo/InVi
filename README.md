# About

This is the Repository of the project of the Information Visualisation course at the VUB. The group creating this project consists of: Trieu Thanh Ngoan, Mathijs Saey, Kenny Deschuyteneer and David Sverdlov.

# Goal

The goal of this project is the visualization of current musical trends based on [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/). The user of this tool will be able to see an at-a-glance overview of the current top artists or tracks of the planet. Furthermore, the user can see how his/her favourite artist/track is doing on a heatmap visualization of the world. Finally, users can zoom in on the various countries of the world, to view the same data, adjusted to reflect the popularity of this track/artist for this particular country.
