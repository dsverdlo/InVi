# About

This is the Repository of the project of the Information Visualisation course at the VUB. The group creating this project consists of: Trieu Thanh Ngoan, Mathijs Saey, Kenny Deschuyteneer and David Sverdlov.

# Goal

For this project, we are planning to visualize the hottest musical trends trends from [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/). We want to be able to visualize how time and location influences the popularity of tracks, artists, and their albums. To do so, we will present the user with an interactive world map, where they can inspect the various data that Last.fm collects, and interact with it. For instance, a user could opt to watch the current trending artists on a world map, and zoom in on a specific country to get more detailed information about this country. A slider will also allow us to visualize the same data at a different point in time.
